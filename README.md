# CodeAlpha Internship 

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my internship projects at CodAlpha! ðŸš€ As an Artificial Intelligence intern. 
## Tasks Overview

## Task 1: FAQ Chatbot Development

### Overview
During my internship at CodAlpha, I undertook the development of a chatbot capable of answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) about a specific topic or product. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the chatbot processes user queries and generates accurate responses, enhancing user engagement and support.The dataset used for this projects are sourced from Kaggle.

### Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Implemented NLP algorithms using NLTK and SpaCy for text understanding and response generation.
- **Dataset Utilization**: Employed a Kaggle dataset containing categorized FAQs to train and test the chatbot.
- **Interactive Interface**: Designed an interactive interface for users to seamlessly interact with the chatbot and receive prompt answers.

## Task 2: Language Translation Tool Development

### Overview
As part of my internship at CodAlpha, I developed a simple language translation tool using machine translation techniques. The tool translates text from one language to another, enhancing accessibility and communication across different linguistic contexts.

### Key Features
- **Machine Translation Techniques**: Implemented methods to translate text effectively using algorithms suitable for language processing.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed an intuitive interface for seamless input and output of translated text.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle translations between multiple languages, accommodating diverse user needs.
